\section{Assembler generation}
The previous chapter showed that the optimizations are not that helpful on decoder code. This thesis was done for evaluating decoder code, so no others projects have been checked. However, other projects like direct UI or CLI implementations also could be evaluated, since the patterns from decoding code are quite different to ui codes. Without evaluating others, we can say, that the optimization for dropping conversion nodes from the graph is not that helpful.
