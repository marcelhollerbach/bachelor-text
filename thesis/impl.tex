\section{Bitwidth analysis}
The analysis is a data flow analysis. The analysis attaches a $(int,boolean)$ tuple to every meaningful node. A node is considered meaningful is the node has a integer style mode. We will reference the first value as \emph{stable bits} and the second bit as \emph{is positive}. Since this is a data flow analysis that is build on a iterative approach we might want to address the current tuple of a node x, while we have a new one calculated. Therefore we call $\hat{x}$ the currently associated value, and $x$ the newly calculated one.

\paragraph{Bit representation}
The stable bits are indicating how many bits are stable, and therefore not used.
The second value of the tuple indicates if the value will ever reach negative numbers or not. And thus indicate at least one stable bit at the highest position. However, the second value is only meaningful for modes that allow signs.

\paragraph{Range representation}
There is also a second way of interpreting the two values. The stable bits can define a minimum and maximum range. The maximum number is reached if the stable bits are just always zero. If the mode is signed and the node is not positive, then the minimum number is reached by assuming all stable bits are one. Otherwise the minimum range is 0. We can define the following min max definitions for the ranges:

$
max_{bitwidth}(x)=
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}2^{stable\_digits-1}-1\\2^{stable\_digits}-1\end{array}
\begin{array}{l} {mode.signed} \\ {Otherwise} \end{array}
\right.
$

$
min_{bitwidth}(x)=
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}2^{stable\_digits-1}\\0\end{array}
\begin{array}{l} {mode.signed and is_positive} \\ {Otherwise} \end{array}
\right.
$

\paragraph{Analysis} The analysis works as a fixed point iteration. Therefore we use  \ref{fig:lattice} as lattice. The values of the lattice are representing the tuples from the analysis.

As a first step, we iterate over every single node and initialize the node with $\top$ and mark it as \textit{dirty}. If the node is constant, we calculate its bitwidth. Nodes with the opcodes \textit{Const}, \textit{Size} and \textit{Address} are considered constant.

The second step consists of recalculating every \textit{dirty} node in the graph. if the stable bits of $x$ are greater than those from $\hat{x}$, then the new value is memorized as $\hat{x}$ of the node and every successor of the node is marked as dirty. The used rules for recalculating the nodes are described in \ref{table_of_rules}.

\subsection{Value prediction}
In addition to the normal analysis results, the fixed point iteration can insert additional 
confirm nodes. Those confirm nodes help making the analysis more accurate.
First of all we need a few definitions for easier understanding:

\subparagraph{Definition: True / false Blocks}
A compare node in \libFIRM has always a relation, 2 operands and 2 blocks. One of the blocks is executed depending on if the criteria was meet or not. The block that is executed when it was meet, is called \emph{true-block} the other block is called \emph{false-block}. The structure is visualized in \ref{fig:compare_upper_bound}
\input{fig/upper_bound_cmp.tex}

\subparagraph{Definition: Upper bounds}
A node defines a upper bound if the relation is < and the second operand is constant.\newline
A compare node is also defining a upper bound if it can be transformed into a construct that matches the definition. For example by switching the right and left nodes, while turning the relation.

\subparagraph{Definition: Predecessor in a certain block}
In the detection described later, we often need to find a predecessor that is placed in a certain block. Therefore we define:
\begin{center}
$\kappa(a, b) := \{X| X \leftarrow a \wedge X.block = b \}$ 
\end{center}

It will return every node that is located in \textit{b} and is a predecessor of \textit{a}.

\subparagraph{Definition: Constant dependencies}
\input{fig/def_xi.tex}
While looking at C code we often see that addition and multiplication nodes are used for calculating array addresses or addresses for structure access. Therefore one operant of the arithmetical operations is often constant. A example for this can be found at \ref{fig:def:xi}.
We define $\xi$ to explore the whole tree of one constant one not constant operants, and return us every node that was not constant.
\begin{center}
$\xi(a) := 
\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		a \cup \xi(c)\\ 
		\emptyset
	\end{array}
	\begin{array}{l}
		, \text{If there is only one not constant dependency \textit{c}} \\ 
		, \text{otherwise}.
	\end{array}
\right.$
\end{center}

If \textit{a} has only one not constant operant c, then $\xi$ returns the element a and $\xi(c)$. Otherwise it returns a empty set. For the example the highlighted nodes will be part of $\xi(Y)$.

\paragraph{Upper bounds for block execution}
The values that are calculated in a node are (even if the fixed point iteration is not stable yet) possible values. The iteration starts at $\bot$ and moves into the direction of $\top$. 
%This means for a node \textit{n} our range of possible values starts at something like $[0,0]$, moving towards $[max _{bitwidth}(n), min _{bitwidth}(n)]$ with each iteration.  %CORRECTION LINE
We now evaluate a upper bound compare node, every time the first operand changes. In the beginning we can say that that with those possible values, each time the true-block will be executed. However, if $max _{bitwidth}(n)$ grows enough to get bigger than the second operand or the compare node, then we can say that we have found a upper bound for the execution of the true-block. Which is $max _{bitwidth}(n)$ in the current state. Thus we can insert a confirm node between every node $e \in \kappa(i, j)$ and $i$. Where $i$ is the first operand and j is the true block.

\paragraph{Extended confirm insertion}
The confirm nodes that we have inserted in the paragraph before can also be transported backwards.
With $\xi(i)$ we can get a set of nodes, where the current state in the analysis is only depending on one node. Thus we can say that the state of every node from $\xi(i)$ will not change as long as the most upper element in the tree structure does not change. Which means that we can for every $e \in \xi(i)$ and $g \in \kappa(e, j)$ insert a confirm node between $(e,g)$

\subsection{Difference to VRP}

There is already a analysis that is doing something similar, it is called value range propagation. The difference from VRP to BA is that in VRP each iteration is trying to predict the exact range after each operation. While BA tries to predict the unused bits after each operation. This little detail is mainly showing up in speed of the fixed point iteration, VRP converges way slower than BA. Details for this are given in the evaluation chapter \ref{sec:eval}.

\section{Stable Conversion nodes}
In libfirm a conversion node can be used to convert one dataword from one mode to another. This type of node has one operand. Such a conversion has two effects. The bitwise representation stays the same. Or the bitwise representation changes, due to the numerical representation changes. We call the first case \textit{Stable Conversion node}.  A example for a unstable conversion node may look like $(unsigned)((int)-10)$. A stable conversion node might look like $(unsigned)(int)10$.

\paragraph{Finding stable conversion nodes}
Such stable conversion nodes can be found using the bitwidth analysis. We compare the range from the operand with the range from the conversion node itself. If the ranges are the same, then we know that the conversion is stable.

\paragraph{Removing conversion nodes}
\input{fig/conv_opt.tex}
In case we found a stable conversion node, then we can say that this node only exists for syntax rules, there is no semantical value in them. Removing those nodes also has the advantage of helping other analyses. The confirm insertion algorithm of libfirm is searching for assertions that can be made based on looking at compare nodes. This works quite well. However, the example at \ref{fig:example:conversion_opt} does not work
The insertion code could only insert a Confirm between the Compare and the conversion. However, it would need to be behind the conversion node, in order to help the rest of the code, since other nodes will likely depend on the operand of the conversion node and not on the conversion node itself. 
After removing the conversion node, the analysis can find a assertion based on the compare node. This also helps the branch prediction and dead code elimination.

However, for really removing the conversion nodes, we need to find situations where we can eliminate the conversion node. We have already seen the example with a compare node. Additionally we can do the same with a arithmetical operation.

\paragraph{Compare-Conversion optimization}
There is the rule in libfirm that the two operands of a compare node are forced to have the same mode. This means, when we remove the conversion node, we also need to adjust the mode of the second operand. This is not easily possible for something that is not a constant, thus we confine for now that the two operands need to be a conversion and a constant node.
With the assertion that our second operand is a constant, we can simply adjust its mode. And remove the conversion. 

\paragraph{Arithmetical-Conversion optimization}
\input{fig/arith_conv.tex}
A other situation where we can optimize the conversion nodes are arithmetical operations, where one operand is again constant. In this case we don't really remove the conversion node, we more drag it through the arithmetical operation, and place it afterwards. We do this and hope that we can remove it with a compare conversion optimization after that.
Such a construct might look like \ref{fig:example:arithmetical_opt} . After we adjusted the mode of the constant we can move the conversion from the operand of the arithmetical operation to the end.
